## About 
My career and life focus is on how information communicates. Previously, that has manifest itself as building data applications that help people make data driven decisions.  Currently, as a side project/passion, that looks like working on note-taking workflows that help people more confidently consume, retain, and integrate the vast amount of information available to us in the twenty-first century.  

I'm not big on self-promotion or building a self brand; I care much more about helping others achieve their visions with excellence, sustainablity, and joyous energy.

## Technologies
I'm confident talking about:
- Backend development using Python or Rust
- Financial Data Applications
- Data Visualiations using D3.js
